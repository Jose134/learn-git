Hello! My name is Jos√© Manuel. I'm a fullstack developer, tech enthusiast, graduated from computer science and currently working as a backend engineer.

Git was one of these things that I never payed too much attention to. I only knew the very basics. But once I started working in software development... How do I resolve merge conflicts again? What do I do if I detached the head? Why can't I switch branches now? What's this stash thing? Damn I missed a file in my commit!

I decided it was time to really learn git. And let me tell you, it was a great decision. I realized knowing git is one of the most helpful skills you can have as a developer.

Now that I'm happy with my own skills I decided to share this knowledge with everyone (and practice some Angular along the way). Giving birth to the learn-git project.
